I have created user interface for the Task Management Application with the following features: 
- A landing page displaying a list of tasks.
- Ability for users to add new tasks with a title, description, and due date.
- Ability for users to view detailed information of each task.
- Option to edit existing tasks.
- Option to delete tasks.
- Responsive design to ensure usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

To execute first extract the zip file then open it into the vsCode and execute it.
